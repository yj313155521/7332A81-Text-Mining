While the best way to do this would be to [update spaCy&rsquo;s NER model](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#updating) using domain-specific training data, for this lab it suffices to write code to post-process the output produced by spaCy. To filter out specific labels it is useful to know the named entity label scheme, which can be found in the [model's documentation](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_sm).
